          <h5>Before going ahead, I would like to make you inform that following was selected for college speech.</h5>
          
          <p>False Evidences Appeared to be Real. Being afraid of anything that has not yet happened and even may never happen , based on past thoughts , beliefs and conditioning.</p>
          
          <p>FEAR IS THAT VOICE INSIDE YOU THAT SAY’S YOU CAN’T. IT DEPRECIATES YOUR WILL POWER BY QUESTIONING YOU LIKE:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Will you be able to do it ?</li>
            <li>Will it work and be in your favour ?</li>
            <li>How people gonna react and think of this ? Is it really Necessary ?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Everyone has Fear of Something or another thing.Fear could be of anything . It could be of Public Speaking, fear of Failure, anxiety, fear of open spaces, flying, enclosed spaces, insects, dogs, Business meetings etc.</p>

          <p>It’s just the matter of time how long it take them to overcome their Fear makes all the difference.Whether to be Feared for something and have grudge for it or overcome your Fear and grab every opportunity that comes under your way.</p>

          <p>My Mathematics Professor , generally says : <u>If you are fearful of Failure.Don’t be afraid of it , It is crucial for your Success. The Purpose of Our lives is to be Happy not to be feared of anything . Don’t Let Fear Stop You.</u></p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">freedom of speech, freedom of worship, <br>freedom from want,freedom from fear.<br>+Franklin D. Roosevelt</blockquote>
          
          <p>Facing your Fear (whether in form of Hurdle or Challenges) is a way to push ourselves further and becoming more capable and stronger. Sometimes It could be unpleasant like running faster in race or learn something new or having one on one discussion with HR over new Project but Overcoming over it would be Very Enjoyable! Fear is the final Hurdle to being on the path of your Dreams. You will be able to Embrace the Fear instead of letting it stop you.If you’re feared if something, to get out of it is to do it.</p>
          
          <h3>I have read somewhere that, Most common (number one.) reason for failures:</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>It’s not your Luck</li>
            <li>It’s not the lack of Resources & Opportunity or Money</li>
            <li>It’s Certainly not Circumstances</li>
            <li>It’s FEAR</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Some common approaches to conquer the Fear:</h3>

          <p><b>AGE: </b>is just a number. Success is not destined by one’s age it’s destined by his/her Hard-work in right direction.</p>
          
          <p><b>WHAT PEOPLE WOULD THINK OF ME: </b>Let other’s think whatever they want, You cannot stop them. It’s you how gonna react over them. Whether to just laugh and go on or feel grudge of it and feel down of yourself.</p>

          <p><b>TOXIC PEOPLE: </b>get rid of them because they are made to spread negativity. They could be your Close relatives or your close friend.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE PAST OR FUTURE: </b>why wasting your time thinking over your past or future. Past cannot return back and future is Unpredictable. Live in Present and Be in present.(Look for Future Opportunities).</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Accept your Past.</li>
            <li>Accept the Uncertainty of Future.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Fear doesn’t define us. We have to be Fearless to reach immense Happiness of Life.</p>
          
          <h2>BE STRONG. BE CONFIDENT. BE FEARLESS.</h2>
